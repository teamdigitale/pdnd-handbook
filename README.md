# Handbook for Piattaforma Digitale Nazionale Dati (PDND), previously DAF

The PDND Team handbook is the central repository for how we run the project.
As part of our value of supporting the open source philosophy, the handbook is open to the world, and we welcome feedback. Please make a [pull request](https://github.com/teamdigitale/pdnd-handbook/pulls) to suggest improvements or add clarifications. Please use [issues](https://github.com/teamdigitale/pdnd-handbook/issues) to ask questions.

The idea is to make this notebook become something like [Gitlab’s](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/), and gets also some inspiration from the [Remote Manifesto](https://www.remoteonly.org/) and [Valve Handbook](https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/apps/valve/Valve_NewEmployeeHandbook.pdf) and [Basecamp's handbook](https://github.com/basecamp/handbook).

## What is the PDND (ex DAF)?

PDND stays for "Piattaforma Digitale Nazionale Dati" (the Italian Digital Data Platform), previously known as Data & Analytics Framework (DAF).

You can find more informations about the PDND on the official [Digital Transformation Team website](https://teamdigitale.governo.it/it/projects/daf.htm).
